# 9. Write a Python Program to Calculate the Area of a Triangle.

# Traditional Method
base = float(input("Enter the length of the base of the triangle >>> "))
height = float(input("Enter the length of the height of the triangle >>> "))

print(f"Area of the triangle is {1 / 2 * base * height} units^2")
print("From next time, pay attention to your Maths Classes!")
